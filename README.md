# Open Budget Grand Rapids

**Slack:** #project-openbudgetgr

**Project Description:**
We are developing a way to better understand the budget process for the City of Grand Rapids. This is the follow-up to the initial 2016 release of [openbudgetgr.org](http://openbudgetgr.org). The site is now current with FY2018 data.

Our Open Budget project intends to promotes a deeper understanding of the city budget, so that citizens, officials, and other stakeholders can engage in more informed dialogue about how the City of Grand Rapids currently works and how it should in the future.

The Open Budget website is built using Node.js. During development the project is run locally on a computer. After acquiring and formatting the budget data properly you publish the website using Harp to compile the static files necessary for a Github posted website.
